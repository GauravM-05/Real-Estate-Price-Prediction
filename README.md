# Real Estate Price Prediction
## Overview

This project aims to predict real estate prices using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical housing data, the model helps estimate property values based on key features such as location, size, number of rooms, and amenities. The objective is to assist buyers, sellers, and real estate agencies in making informed pricing decisions.


## Key Features

* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and normalizing features.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing price trends and correlations.

* Feature Engineering: Selecting the most influential factors affecting prices.

* Machine Learning Models: Implementing regression models for price prediction.

* Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

* Predictions & Insights: Providing actionable insights for the real estate market.
## Technology Used

* Programming Language: Python

* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

* Tools: Jupyter Notebook
